# Contributing to Ford MK4 Tool

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!  
This tool is still in development and *untested*, so any help is appreciated — from bug reports to code improvements or testing on actual vehicles.

- 🐞 **Report bugs** or weird behavior  
- 🧼 **Clean up code** or improve structure  
- ✍️ **Improve docs** (like this one!)  
- 🧪 **Add test cases** or logging
